    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]

      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:
      arr = [1, -1 , 55] 
            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]
            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]
