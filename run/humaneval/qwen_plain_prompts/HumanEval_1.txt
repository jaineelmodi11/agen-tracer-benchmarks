You will receive a Python function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no print). The body must be 4-space indented, valid, and handle edge cases. Do not reference variables that you have not defined.
Return just the indented body with nothing else.

    Ignore any spaces in the input string.

    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
