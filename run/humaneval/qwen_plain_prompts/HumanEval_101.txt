You will receive a Python function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no print). The body must be 4-space indented, valid, and handle edge cases. Do not reference variables that you have not defined.
Return just the indented body with nothing else.

    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
