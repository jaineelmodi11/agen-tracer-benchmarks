def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    To solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses and returning the maximum depth of nesting for each group, you can use a recursive approach. Here's a Python implementation that addresses the requirements:

    ```python
    from typing import List
