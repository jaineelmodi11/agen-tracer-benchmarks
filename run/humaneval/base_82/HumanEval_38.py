    Assistant: The provided code snippet defines two functions: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. These functions take a string as input and encode it cyclically by cycling every three characters into the next group. They then decode the encoded string back to its original form.

    Here's a breakdown of how these functions work:
