def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])

    """
    To solve this problem, you can use a list to keep track of the maximum values seen so far. Here's how you can implement it:

    ```python
    from typing import List, Tuple
