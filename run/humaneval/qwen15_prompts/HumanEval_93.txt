<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'

Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
