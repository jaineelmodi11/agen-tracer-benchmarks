You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

    Example 1:

        Input: 3
        Output: (1, 2)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.

    Example 2:

        Input: 12
        Output: (4, 6)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.

    Note:
        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.
