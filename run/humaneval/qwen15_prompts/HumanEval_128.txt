<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    >>> prod_signs([]) == None
    """


Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
