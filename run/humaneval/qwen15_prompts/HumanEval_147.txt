<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def get_max_triples(n):
    """
    You are given a positive integer n. You have to create an integer array a of length n.
        For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the value of a[i] = i * i - i + 1.
        Return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k, 
    and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

    Example :
        Input: n = 5
        Output: 1
        Explanation: 
        a = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]
        The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13).

Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
