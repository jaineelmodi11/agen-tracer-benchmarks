<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """


Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
