<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def is_happy(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
    For example:
    is_happy(a) => False
    is_happy(aa) => False
    is_happy(abcd) => True
    is_happy(aabb) => False
    is_happy(adb) => True
    is_happy(xyy) => False
    """


Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
