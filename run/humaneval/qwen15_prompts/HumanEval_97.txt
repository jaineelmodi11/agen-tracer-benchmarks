<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def multiply(a, b):
    """Complete the function that takes two integers and returns 
    the product of their unit digits.
    Assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.
    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.
    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.
    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.

Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
