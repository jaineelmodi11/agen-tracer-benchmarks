<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def compare_one(a, b):
    """
    Create a function that takes integers, floats, or strings representing
    real numbers, and returns the larger variable in its given variable type.
    Return None if the values are equal.
    Note: If a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,

    compare_one(1, 2.5) ➞ 2.5
    compare_one(1, "2,3") ➞ "2,3"

Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
