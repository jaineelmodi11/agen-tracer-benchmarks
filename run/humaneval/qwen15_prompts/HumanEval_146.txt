<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """


Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
