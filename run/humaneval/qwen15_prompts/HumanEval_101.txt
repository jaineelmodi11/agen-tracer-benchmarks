<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """


Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
