<|im_start|>system
You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def fibfib(n: int):
    """The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.

Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
