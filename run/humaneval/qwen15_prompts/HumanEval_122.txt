You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def add_elements(arr, k):
    """
    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return
    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.

    Example:

        Input: arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4
        Output: 24 # sum of 21 + 3

    Constraints:
        1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100
        2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)
    """


Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
