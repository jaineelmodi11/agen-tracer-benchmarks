You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text).
Rules:
1) The body must be 4-space indented, syntactically valid, and executable with the given signature.
2) Do not use names you didn't define. Do not print/read input.
3) Prefer simple, correct solutions over clever ones. Handle edge cases.
4) Output just the body.

def unique_digits(x):
    """Given a list of positive integers x. return a sorted list of all 
    elements that hasn't any even digit.

    Note: Returned list should be sorted in increasing order.
    
    For example:
    >>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
    [1, 15, 33]
    >>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])

Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
