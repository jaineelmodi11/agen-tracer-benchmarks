from typing import List


def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
    To complete the function `string_xor` from the given code snippet, we need to perform a binary XOR operation on the two input strings `a` and `b`. Here's the corrected and complete implementation:

    ```python
    from typing import List
