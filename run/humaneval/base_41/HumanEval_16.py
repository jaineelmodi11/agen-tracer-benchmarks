    ```

    This code snippet defines a function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string as input and returns the number of unique characters in it. The solution uses Python's built-in `set` data structure to remove duplicates and then counts the elements using the `len()` function. The provided test cases check for both correct and incorrect usage scenarios. If all tests pass, the program will print "All test cases passed." Otherwise, it will indicate which test cases did not pass. This approach ensures that the
