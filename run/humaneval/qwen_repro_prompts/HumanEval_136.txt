You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text). Indent with 4 spaces. Do not reference variables you have not defined. Prefer simple, correct solutions.<|im_end|>

def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    '''
    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
    largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)
    '''


Return ONLY the 4-space-indented function body.<|im_end|>
