You are a senior Python coding assistant.
You will receive a function signature and docstring. Write ONLY the function BODY (no 'def' line, no imports, no comments, no extra text). Indent with 4 spaces. Do not reference variables you have not defined. Prefer simple, correct solutions.<|im_end|>

def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number
