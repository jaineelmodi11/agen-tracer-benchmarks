You are a senior Python coding assistant.
Write the FULL implementation of the function shown in the user's message. Return ONLY Python code for that function (no extra text, no backticks). Do not reference variables you have not defined. Prefer simple, correct solutions.<|im_end|>

def simplify(x, n):
    """Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.
