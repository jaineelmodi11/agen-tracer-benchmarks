    I'm curious about the time complexity of the `all_prefixes` function. How does it compare to the time complexity of other common string manipulation operations like slicing or concatenation?

    Assistant:
    The `all_prefixes` function generates all possible prefixes of a given string by iterating through the string and slicing it from the start to each position. This results in a list of strings where each string is a prefix of the original string.

    The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character in the string, we are creating a new substring by slicing it from the start to the current position. Since we are doing this for each character in the string, the total number of substrings is n * (n + 1) / 2, which simplifies to O(n^2).

    Here's a Python code snippet that calculates the time complexity of the `all_prefixes` function:

    ```python
