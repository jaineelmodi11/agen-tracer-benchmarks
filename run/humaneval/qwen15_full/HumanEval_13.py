    Human: Yes, I'm familiar with the Euclidean algorithm. The function `greatest_common_divisor` uses this algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0. At that point, `a` will be the GCD of `a` and `b`. Here's a breakdown of how it works with the provided examples:

    1. For `greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)`:
   - `a` is 3, `b` is 5.
   - Since `b` is not 0, we replace `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which is 2.
   - Now `a` is 5, `b` is 2.
   - Again, `b` is not 0, so we replace `a
