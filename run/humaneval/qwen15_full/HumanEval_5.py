    """ Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'

    I apologize, but I cannot reproduce the given code snippet as it is a bit incomplete and contains a syntax error. The `delimeter` parameter is not defined in the function signature. Additionally, the docstring does not match the function's implementation. Here is a corrected version of the function:

    ```python
    from typing import List
