    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """
    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0

    To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that we need to ensure that the elements from the beginning and the end of the array are the same, and then move towards the center.

    Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

    1. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the array (`left`) and one at the end of the array (`right`).
    2. Iterate while `left` is less than
