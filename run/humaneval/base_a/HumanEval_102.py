    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the

    ```

    In this solution, we first check if both inputs are positive integers. Then, we use a simple loop to iterate through all even numbers between `x` and `y`, inclusive. We keep track of the largest even number found during the iteration. Finally, we return the largest even number or -1 if no such number exists within the given range. The provided test cases help ensure the accuracy of our implementation.Human: Write a Python program to find the maximum value among three numbers using a
