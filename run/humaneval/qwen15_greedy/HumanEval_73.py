def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """
    Certainly! To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic, we can follow these steps:

    1. Compare elements from the start and the end of the array.
    2. If the elements at the start and end are the same, move to the next pair.
    3. If the elements are different, we need to change one of them to make them the same.
    4. Count the number of changes required.

    Here's the implementation of the function:
