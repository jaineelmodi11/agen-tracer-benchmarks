def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
    order them based on their index in original list.

    For example:
    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
    >>> order_by_points([]) == []
    """
    To solve this problem, we need to sort the list of integers first by their absolute values (to handle negative numbers correctly), then by their digit sums. Here's how you can implement this:

    ```python
    from typing import List
