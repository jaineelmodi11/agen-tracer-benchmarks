    Create a function that returns a tuple (a, b), where 'a' is
    the largest of negative integers, and 'b' is the smallest
    of positive integers in a list.
    If there is no negative or positive integers, return them as None.

    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) == (None, 1)
    largest_smallest_integers([]) == (None, None)
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) == (None, None)

    largest = None
    smallest = None

    # Iterate through each element in the list
    for num in lst:
    # Update the largest integer if the current number is greater than the current largest
    if num > largest:
        largest = num
    # Update the smallest integer if the current number is smaller than the current smallest
