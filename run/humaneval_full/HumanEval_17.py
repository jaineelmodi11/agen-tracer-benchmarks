def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.
    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each
    not last.

    Here is a legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quater note, lasts one beat

    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
    """
    To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given music string and count the number of beats for each type of note ('o', '|', '.') using a dictionary to map these characters to their respective counts. Here's how you can implement this:

    ```python
    from typing import List
